Computer stores the value in binary of any decimal values

no of bits is decided by data types like for int bits are 32
so for the int a = 32 
it will store first 28 bit 0 and last 4 are 1101

operations like AND, OR, XOR, SHIFT, NOT

## in XOR if same then 0
       if different then 1

so for 0 0 and 1 1 output is 0
   for 1 0 and 0 1 output is 1

## SHIFT operator

1. Right shift ( >> )

int x = 13 >> 1;

here we have to shift right shift the 13 binary equavalent to one time
so 13 = (1101) will become (0110) which is 6
so right shift will '''devide number by 2''' so ```6 = 13 / 2```

2. Left Shift ( << )

int x = 13 << 1;

so 13 = (1101) will become (11010) = 26
so number multiply by 2
26 = 13 * 2


// 29.00
